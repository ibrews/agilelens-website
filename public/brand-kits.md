## Variation B: Bold/Theatrical

### Rationale
Agile Lens was literally born from theater and architecture. This direction embraces that origin story — it's playful, warm, and memorable. It says "we're creatives who build impossible things." The theater metaphor (acts, curtain, stage) creates a unique identity no other XR studio has.

### Colors
- **Primary background:** #0D0015 (deep purple-black)
- **Surface:** #1A0028 (midnight purple)
- **Accent 1:** #FF6B35 (warm theatrical orange — stage lights)
- **Accent 2:** #C77DFF (soft purple — theater curtain)
- **Text:** #F0E6FF (lavender white)
- **Muted:** #A78BCC (dusty purple)

### Typography
- **Headlines:** System font stack, bold/black weight (dramatic impact)
- **Body:** Inter (readable against dark backgrounds)
- **Special:** Italic for emphasis (theatrical tradition)

### Tone
- Playful, bold, storytelling-driven
- Theater metaphors: "acts," "programs," "standing ovation"
- Warm and human — shows personality
- Emoji used sparingly but with purpose

### Best For
Entertainment clients, performers, media companies, festival submissions

## Variation C: Immersive/Dark

### Rationale
This is the "future is now" direction. Pure black with cyan and green accents creates a sci-fi, Tron-like aesthetic that signals cutting-edge technology. The terminal/monospace typography feels like you're accessing a high-tech system. Perfect for impressing tech-forward clients and standing out at XR conferences.

### Colors
- **Primary background:** #000000 (pure black)
- **Surface:** #0A0A0A (near-black)
- **Accent 1:** #00D4FF (electric cyan)
- **Accent 2:** #00FF88 (matrix green)
- **Text:** #FFFFFF (pure white)
- **Muted:** #666666
- **Border:** Cyan at 10-30% opacity

### Typography
- **Headlines:** System font stack, black weight, tight tracking
- **Body/Labels:** Monospace (JetBrains Mono or system mono)
- **Special:** All-caps for product names and CTAs

### Tone
- Technical, confident, futuristic
- Terminal-inspired language: "system online," "initialize," "active"
- Data-driven presentation
- Minimal decoration — the glow IS the decoration

### Best For
Tech companies, VR hardware makers, innovation-focused brands, conference presentations
