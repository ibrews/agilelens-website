    description: 'RUMPAC will house a three-tiered, 600-seat, European-style opera theatre with an orchestra pit for 70 musicians. "The opera house is a visual overture to prepare the audience to enter into the magical world conjured by the music, the story and the theatrical setting of the opera," said architect Allan Greenberg. "It facilitates a journey into the mind of the composer, in which the human voice gives breath to a living fantasy." Agile Lens has utilized virtual reality on this project from the earliest concept studies all the way through its now completed design (the project is currently under construction). This constantly updated VR model allowed the unique opportunity to evaluate the design at different stages, all while bearing in mind the human-scale experience of it. In concept design, the team utilized VR sketches and diagrammatic spatial models to determine the strongest overall direction in which to proceed. As the design developed, further options were built into the custom VR experience to determine ideal locations for aisles, seats, railings, catwalks, and lights. As the project neared completion, Agile Lens moved the project from the Unity3D visualization engine to Unreal Engine in order to better serve the photorealistic needs of the lighting and materials. In 2018 their work was a featured case study on Unreal Engine\'s website.',

    description: 'When Intel set out to showcase the power of the Intel Core i9 processor for a virtual reality project, they wanted to go big. As in, arena big. Not just with the structure itself, but with its most striking feature - the thousands of enthusiastic fans inside it. To show how its processors could handle such a computationally-intensive project, Intel commissioned Project Arena, a large virtual facility complete with a playing area, arena seating, lobby, and food court. The experience also includes thousands of virtual 3D fans who not only walk, sit, and move around like a real crowd, but also stand up and cheer at the click of a button. Beyond that, you can even pick a view you enjoy and with the click of a button, snap a beautiful V-Ray render. Agile Lens was brought on to lead the development of this one-of-a-kind VR experience. Working in collaboration with The Glimpse Group, Octopus, Supersymmetric, and HOK (who provided their 3D model of State Farm Arena), the project continuously evolved to accommodate innovative new possibilities, all the while keeping expectations in line with the capabilities of the target technology. The result is a powerful showcase of virtual reality at its most epic.',

This dual-audience format was facilitated using three HTC Vive headsets and High Fidelity\'s social VR platform, which allowed for innovative use of virtual avatars and a seamless integration of virtual and real-world elements. The setup included live broadcast audio and a virtual camera system that projected the virtual theater experience into the physical theater, and vice versa, enriching the interactive experience for all attendees.

The limited mobility is organic to the setting (a speed-dating scenario) and also keeps the AR objects well within the headset\'s field of view. It also allowed us to use single-angle volumetric shots, as the user would not be able to see the back half of the subjects anyway.\nWe brought in collaborating artists from the NYC comedy and theater scene, compiled the scripts over the course of a month, and then shot each of the 17 vignettes over the course of a week. Those assets were assembled into a functional app within another 6 weeks.',

    overview: 'This 5,300 square foot space allows guests to virtually experience what $300 million worth of amenities and shared facilities will feel like at Four Seasons Private Residences. Guests can walk freely and wirelessly around an 82 x 65-foot space and feel like they are walking around a finished residence, the lake clubhouse, indoor sports club, private restaurant, and theater. The experience ends with guests walking into a virtual 96-seat theater and then sitting in four real theater seats.',

    description: 'Agile Lens worked in the development and production phases of this project; we optimized the levels that Pureblink built from DBox\'s renders, and assembled the software experience to navigate between those levels. We also led the setup and implementation of the holodeck itself, working with the client to develop the entire guest experience from entering the holodeck through the virtual tour. We staffed and managed the first 6 months of operation and managed the operations handoff to a local team.',

    overview: '"La Pasion XR" takes guests on an ephemeral, audio-reactive journey through the Gateway Chamber Orchestra\'s performance of Osvaldo Golijov\'s La Pasion segun San Marcos. Guests begin downstage in a point cloud scan of the concert hall. There is a soft hum from instruments and music stands dissolving in and out of existence, and guests are presented with a menu for selecting an experience mode, viewing controls and credits. They can freely navigate the theater in their VR headset using teleportation, smooth locomotion and snap rotation. Experience options include a volumetric highlight sequence of the concert and two full featured movements to explore, each with bonus 360 video content and more.',
