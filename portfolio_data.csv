"Frederic Church Ombra Exhibition","Completed","2019","2019","iOS","","","Sage and Coome Architects","""Frederic Church’s Ombra: Architecture in Conversation with Nature” showcases multimedia design concepts and installations, developed by leading architects and select artists.  As Guest Curator, Barry Bergdoll (of Columbia University and the Museum of Modern Art) invited a group of today’s most exploratory architects to respond to the transitional outdoor rooms at Olana that are so essential to the original 19th century design of Olana’s Main House. These architects were asked to examine assumptions about the relationship of architecture and landscape at Olana, as well as to explore the Main House’s transition to the surrounding natural environment, particularly in our time of climactic and environmental change. Agile Lens was brought on by Sage & Coome for the digital side of their contribution.","","https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OjfEgdqIzB-yEgrazHnzjPg4QD91P8gw?usp=drive_link","Built an iOS AR app for Sage and Coombe Architects to locate their design work (alongside that of artist Chris Doyle) as part of an architectural exhibition.

This constantly updated VR model allowed the unique opportunity to evaluate the design at different stages, all while bearing in mind the human-scale experience of it. In concept design, the team utilized VR sketches and diagrammatic spatial models to determine the strongest overall direction in which to proceed. As the design developed, further options were built into the custom VR experience to determine ideal locations for aisles, seats, railings, catwalks, and lights. As the project neared completion, Agile Lens moved the project from the Unity3D visualization engine to Unreal Engine in order to better serve the photorealistic needs of the lighting and materials. In 2018 their work was a featured case study on Unreal Engine’s website.","","Unity, Unreal, Revit","","","","Architecture","","","Architecture","","","","","","","","","",""

As in, arena big. Not just with the structure itself, but with its most striking feature - the thousands of enthusiastic fans inside it. To show how its processors could handle such a computationally-intensive project, Intel commissioned Project Arena, a large virtual facility complete with a playing area, arena seating, lobby, and food court. The experience also includes thousands of virtual 3D fans who not only walk, sit, and move around like a real crowd, but also stand up and cheer at the click of a button. Beyond that, you can even pick a view you enjoy and with the click of a button, snap a beautiful V-Ray render. Agile Lens was brought on to lead the development of this one-of-a-kind VR experience. Working in collaboration with The Glimpse Group, Octopus, Supersymmetric, and HOK (who provided their 3D model of State Farm Arena), the project continuously evolved to accomodate innovative new possibilities, all the while keeping expectations in line with the capabilities of the target technology. The result is a powerful showcase of virtual reality at its most epic.","","Revit","The Glimpse Group, Octopus, Supersymmetric, HOK","","https://unrealengine.com/en-US/spotlights/intel-vr-arena-and-unreal-engine-making-a-fan-experience

This dual-audience format was facilitated using three HTC Vive headsets and High Fidelity’s social VR platform, which allowed for innovative use of virtual avatars and a seamless integration of virtual and real-world elements.

An example: volcap looks more like that actual performer but is more 'baked,' while mocap has less realism but also allows for more post-production and real-time interactivity, such as always having a character look at you.

Additionally, we wanted to combat the perception that producing such an experience is prohibitively expensive, as we created this on minimal budget using  consumer-level technology.","","Depthkit, Unity, Microsoft Azure Kinect, Vive Trackers","Written & Performed by Josephine Simple","","","Performance Research (Non-billable)","Entertainment","","Performance","","","","","","","","","",""
